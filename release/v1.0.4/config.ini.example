# Alnoor Medical Services - Configuration File
# 
# This file controls where the application stores its database.
# 
# DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:
# 
# 1. LOCAL DEPLOYMENT (Default - no config.ini needed)
#    - Database stored in user's AppData folder
#    - Each PC has its own separate database
#    - No configuration required
# 
# 2. NETWORK DEPLOYMENT (Requires config.ini)
#    - Database stored on shared network drive
#    - Multiple PCs access the same database
#    - Requires this config file
# 
# NETWORK DEPLOYMENT SETUP:
# 
# 1. Create a network share for the database:
#    Example: \\SERVER\Shared\AlnoorDB\
# 
# 2. Copy this file and rename it to "config.ini" (remove .example)
# 
# 3. Place config.ini in the application directory:
#    C:\Program Files\Alnoor Medical Services\config.ini
# 
# 4. Uncomment and edit the [database] section below
# 
# 5. Install the application on each PC that needs access
# 
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Use UNC paths (\\SERVER\Share\...) for network databases
# - Install the APPLICATION locally on each PC (C:\Program Files\...)
# - Only the DATABASE should be on the network share
# - Ensure all PCs have read/write access to the network share
# - Set up automated daily backups (see NETWORK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
#
